        <p>You are standing in an open field west of a white <u>h</u>ouse, with a boarded front <u>d</u>oor.<br></p>

                                     get into some JS. The image below will be replaced with the "console" output and inputs. Probably replace the above too,
                                     and just make a significant chunk of the body here the interactive "console".
